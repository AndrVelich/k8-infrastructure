## Plans

1. ArgoCD for k8s. Deploy the app.
    1. How to manage ArgoCD? By using a separate repo, from terraform, or from the same repo?
    2. Read [some nice articles about terraform and ArgoCD on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/automating-kubernetes-cluster-cicd-setup-terraform-argo-stephen-kuntz)
    3. [A nice setup on CircleCI](https://circleci.com/blog/deploy-to-kubernetes-with-argocd/)
    4. [Watch Native EKS ALB video](https://youtu.be/ZfjpWOC5eoE)
2. Managing kubernetes
    1. [Deploy kubernetes dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/dashboard-tutorial.html)
    2. Understand, how to monitor resources, what
    3. [Understand, how to setup RBAC and users, maybe SSO](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/dashboard-tutorial.html)
    4. [Read Docs on AWS about cluster management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/dashboard-tutorial.html)
    5. Understand how to manage access to namespaces, network policies
3. Setup Ingress solution
    1. [Setup ingress for ArgoCD?](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/ingress/)
    2. Read about traefik as Ingress. Read all Traefik docs?
    3. Investigate how to protect Ingress routes with SSO - [How to implement SSO with Traefik V2 on Kubernetes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/clusters.html)
    4. [Investigate Traeffic service mesh](https://traefik.io/blog/announcing-maesh-a-lightweight-and-simpler-service-mesh-made-by-the-traefik-team-cb866edc6f29/)
    5. Manage DNS internally in k8s?
    6. How to perform redirect from 80 to 443
4. Git Registry
    1. Try to deploy helm chart as well
    2. Verify costs and security settings
    3. Is it possible to use a PAT which allows access with limited packages only?
5. Choose the secrets management solution for Kubernetes
6. Investigate logging and monitoring in k8s
    1. Can we use Grafana for logs? Is it better then ELK?
    2. For monitoring, which dashboards can we automate? And should we?
    3. Read about opentelemetry solution. What we can use?
    4. Which pinging/healthcheck solution to prefer? Can we show some pages of liveness of the web services?
    5. AppSync will be used for frontend. Should we use it as an error backend, are there any alternatives? Should we use AppSync for dashboards?

## Questions to Stan

1. Which SSO to use? Do we need any email management system which can be SSO (like Google)? Can we use Google?
2. Get DNS and setup it in AWS (or maybe anywhere else, like CloudFlare?). Is it possible to integrate it with k8s?

## Jira tasks

1. Setup AWS accounts, roles, groups, SSO

## Completed tasks

1. Setup EKS cluster using terraform
2. Setup karpenter for EKS using terraform
3. Setup ArgoCD using terraform
4. Setup SSO using GitHub for ArgoCD
5. Configure demo NextJS application in Kubernetes using ArgoCD
6. Setup 3 AWS accounts within the same organisation and AWS SSO, basic users, groups and roles
